# Conversion, not casting
- Go has a language to talk about its language.
- Terms have been jettisoned because they come with baggage.
- Re-envision programming. 
- New words to talk about some concepts. 
- We don’t talk about objects we talk about creating TYPES and VALUES of a certain TYPE.
- We don’t talk about casting, we talk about CONVERSION and ASSERTION.
