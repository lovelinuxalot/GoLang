# Constants
- a simple, unchanging value
- Only exist at compile time. 
- there are ***TYPED*** and ***UNTYPED*** constants
  - const hello = "Hello, World"
  - const typedHello string = "Hello, World"
- UNTYPED constant
  - a constant value that does not yet have a fixed type
    - "constant of a ***kind***"
    - not yet forced to obey the strict rules that prevent combining differently typed values
  - An untyped constant can be implicitly converted by the compiler. 
- It is this notion of an untyped constant that makes it possible for us to use constants in Go with great freedom.
  - This is useful, for instance
    - what is the type of 42?
      - int?
      - uint?
      - float64?
    - if we didnâ€™t have UNTYPED constants (constants of a kind), then we would have to do conversion on every literal value we used and that would suck
