# Map - introduction
- A map is a key-value store. 
- This means that you store some value and you access that value by a key. 
- For instance, I might store the value "phoneNumber" and access it be the key "friendName".
- This way I could enter my friend's name and have the map return their phone number. 
- The syntax for a map is **map[key]value**. 
- The key can be of any type which allows comparison (eg, I could use a string or an int, for example, as I can compare if two strings are equal, or if two ints are equal). 
- It is important to note that **maps are unordered**.
- If you **print out all of the keys and values in a map, they will print out in random order**.
- The **comma ok idiom** is also covered in this video. 
- **A map is the perfect data structure when you need to look up data fast.**
