# Slice - composite literal
A SLICE holds VALUES of the same TYPE. If I wanted to store all of my favorite numbers, I would use a slice of int. 
If I wanted to store all of my favorite foods, I would use a slice of string. **We will use a COMPOSITE LITERAL to create a slice.** A composite literal is created by having the TYPE followed by CURLY BRACES and then putting the appropriate values in the curly brace area.
