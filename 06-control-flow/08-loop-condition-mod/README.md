# Loop, conditional, modulus
We iterate in life to improve. This is true for whatever we’re doing. We write the code with errors before we write the code without errors. I had a teacher who called this the “perfection of imperfection.” My teacher would say to me, “You are perfect just the way you are, and there is room for improvement.” The point being - the code we wrote in an earlier video to print out even numbers can be done better. In this video, we are going to do it better. We are going to write code that is more clear. This will serve as a review of the concepts we have been learning: **loops, conditional if statements, and the modulo operator.**
